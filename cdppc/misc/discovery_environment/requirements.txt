# CDP Environment Discovery Tool - Requirements
# 
# This tool uses only Python standard library modules.
# The only external requirement is the CDP CLI, which should be installed separately.
# https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-public-cloud/cloud/cli/topics/mc-installing-cdp-client.html
#
# To install CDP CLI:
#   pip install cdpcli
#
# No additional Python packages are required for this tool to function.
# However, for development and testing, you may want:
#
# Development dependencies (optional):
# pytest>=7.0.0           # For unit testing
# black>=22.0.0           # For code formatting
# flake8>=4.0.0           # For linting
# mypy>=0.950             # For type checking
