# Cloudera Manager Settings Extraction Script

## Overview

This script extracts configuration settings from Cloudera Manager (CM) and **must be executed directly on a Cloudera Manager host**. It utilizes the powerful `xmlstarlet` tool to parse, transform, query, and validate the XML configuration exports generated by CM, ensuring accurate and reliable processing.

## Prerequisites

The script depends on the `xmlstarlet` utility along with several essential system libraries. While these packages and their dependencies are planned to be included in the Cloudera On Cloud repository, you can manually download and install them from RPM packages as needed.

### Required RPM Packages (RHEL 8.x base)

The following RPM packages are required for proper execution of the script and its dependencies:

- basesystem-11-5.el8.noarch.rpm
- bash-4.4.20-5.el8.x86_64.rpm
- filesystem-3.8-6.el8.x86_64.rpm

> **Note:** These RPM files can be organized within a local directory such as `xmlstarlet-rpms/` for convenience.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download all required RPM packages to a local directory on your Cloudera Manager host (e.g., `xmlstarlet-rpms/`).

2. Navigate to the directory containing the RPM files:

   ```bash
   cd xmlstarlet-rpms/
   ```

3. Install `xmlstarlet` along with its dependencies using `yum`:

   ```bash
   sudo yum localinstall xmlstarlet-1.6.1-20.el8.x86_64.rpm
   ```

4. Verify the installation by running:

   ```bash
   xmlstarlet --version
   ```

Once installed, you can execute the extraction script safely on your Cloudera Manager host.
